I've designed my pedal mostly from of the shelf norm metal parts, thus it is easy and cheap to reproduce. However, there are multiple ways to build the pedal. I suggest that you only use this [BOM](BOM.md) as a reference and build your DIY active pedals however you like them. Go to our discord server and search for images to get inspirations.

The first pedal costs me about 300€. Another add-on pedal costed me about 240€, since I bough some of the parts in packs for the first pedal and thus already had them. 

Currently a nicer PCB design is under development, which has the ESP & ADS integrated. It needs to be testet though. I highly recommend to wait for it, as it will be much more user friendly, e.g. the build process will take less than an hour for an experienced craftsman.
