I've designed my pedal mostly from of the shelf norm metal parts, thus it is easy and cheap to built. However, there are multiple ways to build the pedal. 

Here an image of my pedal:

The first pedal costs me about 300€. Another add-on pedal costed me about 240€, since I bough some of the parts in packs for the first pedal and thus already had them.
